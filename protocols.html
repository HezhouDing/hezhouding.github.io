                I ran into lots of difficulties when learning new skills because I had a hard time finding
                resources. So after I collected materials and put together my protocols and pipelines, I
                try to keep good records of them and make them accessible. This page will have
                tutorials on different procedures that I conducted, or codes that I used. Once I organize
                them into easily understandable and navigable protocols, they will be uploaded. My
                protocols will not be perfect! So if there are any suggestions or corrections, please let
                me know.
                Yay to open sciencing!
