            <p><b>Promoting volatile fatty acid production in anaerobic digestion of food waste</b></p>
            <p>
                Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a biological process that breaks down complex
                biodegradable organics in the absence of oxygen. AD process produces value-added
                products volatile fatty acids (VFAs), hydrogen gas, and methane gas (CH<sub>4</sub>), making
                it an important technology for capturing the energy and resources embedded in organic
                wastes. CH<sub>4</sub> is the final product in conventional digesters. However, difficulties in
                obtaining air permits and growing interest in recovering more valuable chemicals, such
                as VFAs (e.g., $1900/ton butyric acid compared to $160/ton CH<sub>4</sub>), are driving research
                into alternatives to CH<sub>4</sub>. VFAs are precursors of CH<sub>4</sub> in AD, therefore, arresting
                CH<sub>4</sub>
                production is needed to promote VFA accumulation. My overarching goal was to develop
                chemical-free methods shaping the microbial communities towards suppressing
                methanogens and favoring hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria.

            <p><b>Investigation of key phosphorus (P) biotransformation pathways in anaerobic
                    digestion using metagenomics</b></p>
            <p>P mines are non-renewable and overexploited due to anthropologic activities, with 80%
                being used as fertilizers. Nearly 50% of the P from mines flows to waste streams. When
                not managed properly, the P in waste enters waterbodies, causing eutrophication. AD
                offers a platform to recover P along with C from these wastes. Yet, very little exploration
                has been done on organic P transformation pathways in AD. Therefore, a map for P
                transformation in AD systems is needed to facilitate P recovery in practice. To address
                this knowledge gap, my current study focuses on determining the transformation and
                fate of P speciation in AD. I will apply metagenomics tools to look in depth at the P-
                transformation related functions of microorganisms present in AD.</p>

            <h2>Skills to Highlight</h2>
            <p>During my PhD, I have developed a set of skills that I am proud of. I do not mean that I
                am very good at them, or better than other researchers in the field. I mean to say that I
                am proud because of the time and the efforts I put in learning these skills.</p>

            <h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
            <p>Because I work with anaerobic digestion, I must work with complex microbial
                communities. The bioinformatics tools that I am familiar with include 16S rDNA analysis,
                and some metagenomics for DNA data obtained from illumina or Nanopore sequencing
                platforms. I use DADA2 for illumina 16S rDNA data processing, and R for the
                subsequent analysis. For Nanopore 16S data, I pieced together a pipeline (Unix) using
                the individual programs written by others. Right now, I am working hard on writing the</p>
            <p>pipeline for metagenomics. The programs for metagenomics data processing and
                analyses are available, but my pipeline aims to have clear explanation for each program
                choice, and to process batches of samples. The pipelines and codes I used or put
                together are/will be publicly available, both on my <a href="https://github.com/HezhouDing">Github</a>
                and this website.</p>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>I never programmed or learnt programming before grad school. And I always tried to
                dodge it. But working with bioinformatics, it was unavoidable to learn how to code. I
                started learning coding in the second year of my PhD. And now I am pretty comfortable
                with R. Once I started working with Nanopore sequencing, I started learning to use
                Bash commands to process big batches of data. Recently, I got my hand on a teeny bit
                of HTML ðŸ˜Š</p>
            <h3>Laboratory Operations</h3>
            <p>You could find more lab skills I have in my CV. Here, I want to mention that I think I am a
                very careful planner when doing lab. I am rather independent in designing
                experiments/protocols. I like to plan experiments very carefully beforehand and keep
                good records of my protocols. I also maintain a clean lab space. </p>
