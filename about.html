            <p>Hello! So happy to meet you here. I am from Chengdu, China, the hometown of pandas
                üêº. I love my city, because it is a place of inclusion, relaxation, but also
                ambition.
            </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am a fourth-year PhD student at NC State University specializing in
                environmental engineering. I work under the advisement of <a
                    href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/the-call-lab/home">Dr. Douglas Call</a>.
                Before I came to the U.S., I went
                to college in Jiangnan University in Jiangsu, China. Back then, I always imagined I‚Äôd
                work in art/design related industry (haha to that). I never would have thought that one
                day I would study abroad or go to grad school. But one day, the impulsive decision hit
                me, and stayed with me. In 2015, I met Dr. Jacqueline McLaughlin, a professor from
                Penn State who came to Jiangnan University to teach our ecology class. Her teaching
                style and enthusiasm for the environment lit the first sparkle for my vision of being a
                researcher. Afterwards, I joined two labs to get exposure to research, and I fell in love
                with it. In 2017, upon graduating college, I moved to the U.S. for my Master‚Äôs at the
                University of Arizona. Then in 2019, I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina for my PhD.

            <h2>The Fun Things</h2>
            <p>I learnt art throughout my childhood (which I stopped to prepare for the college entrance
                exam), so I have some artsy-ish hobbies. I love photography, especially film
                and portraits. Sadly I don‚Äôt have too many models for portrait shooting. So I do
                photography for my friends, and offer free graduation photography for whoever need :D
                Yet word isn't out yet‚Ä¶ So I do not have clients :\

                Besides that, I ‚Äúdesign‚Äù stuff like symposium booklets. You can find my two booklet
                designs here:

                I am also very proud of my conference poster designs. So please catch me at
                conferences!

                Oh btw, I am a big fan of geese! I have a Neon art piece at home which features a
                honking goose. I loved playing the Untitled Goose Game (https://goose.game/) because
                I got to be a mean goose that messed up human‚Äôs properties. I don‚Äôt do that in real life.

            <h2>My Cats</h2>
            <p>
                I have two kitties that I and my husband adopted in 2017 after we moved to Raleigh.
                Daisy the sweet bud and Marble the mean cat. I am a crazy cat person. I almost want to
                adopt every single cat that comes to my sight. It is dangerous.
